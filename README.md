Rust Quire
==========

*Status: Beta*


The ``rust-quire`` is a [Rust][1] port for [quire][2] configuration parsing
library.  It also contains [YAML][3] parser (however, it tuned for
configuration parsing rather than generic YAML parser, e.g. it assumes YAML
always fits memory).

See `doc/` for additional information.
